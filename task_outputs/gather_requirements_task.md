**Detailed Requirements Specification: Automated AI Email Responder**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the detailed requirements for an Automated AI Email Responder application.  The system will fetch new emails, analyze their content, and automatically generate responses based on pre-defined rules and AI-powered insights.  The application will integrate with CrewAI, Flask, Django, IMAP/SMTP, Google Gemini API, and Chainlit.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The Automated AI Email Responder is a software application designed to automate email responses, improving efficiency and productivity for users. It will integrate with existing email accounts and leverage AI to provide intelligent and contextually relevant responses.  The system will be deployed on the CrewAI Enterprise platform.

**2.2 Product Functions**

* **Email Fetching:** The system will periodically fetch new emails from specified email accounts using IMAP.
* **Email Parsing:** Emails will be parsed to extract relevant information such as sender, recipient, subject, and body.
* **Email Classification:** Emails will be classified into predefined categories based on their content using AI models.  This will involve sentiment analysis and topic extraction.
* **Response Generation:** The system will automatically generate responses based on the email classification and pre-defined templates. The Google Gemini API will be utilized to enhance response quality and personalization.
* **Response Sending:** Generated responses will be sent via SMTP.
* **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface (via Chainlit) will be provided for configuration, monitoring, and management of the system.
* **User Management:**  Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented.
* **Administration:**  System administrators will have access to detailed logs, performance metrics, and system configuration settings.
* **CrewAI Integration:** The system will leverage CrewAI's functionalities for AI processing, task management, and deployment.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms will be implemented to address email processing failures and API errors.


**2.3 User Characteristics**

* **System Administrators:**  Responsible for system configuration, monitoring, and maintenance.  Require access to detailed logs and performance metrics.
* **End Users:**  Individuals or teams who will use the system to automate their email responses.  Need a user-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.


**2.4 Operating Environment**

* **Hardware:**  The system will be deployed on CrewAI Enterprise servers. Specific hardware requirements will be determined during the design phase.
* **Software:**  The application will be developed using Python, Flask, Django, IMAP/SMTP libraries, Google Gemini API, and Chainlit.  The CrewAI Enterprise platform will serve as the deployment environment.
* **Network:**  The system will require a stable network connection to access email servers and the Google Gemini API.


**3. Specific Requirements**

**3.1 Functional Requirements**

* **FR1: Email Retrieval:** The system shall retrieve emails from specified email accounts using IMAP.
* **FR2: Email Parsing:** The system shall parse incoming emails and extract sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachments.
* **FR3: Email Classification:** The system shall classify incoming emails into predefined categories using a combination of rule-based and AI-powered methods (Google Gemini API).
* **FR4: Response Generation:** The system shall generate automated responses based on email classification and pre-defined templates.  The Google Gemini API will be used for advanced response generation.
* **FR5: Response Sending:** The system shall send generated responses via SMTP.
* **FR6: User Interface:** The system shall provide a user-friendly interface (Chainlit) for configuring email accounts, managing templates, monitoring system performance, and viewing logs.
* **FR7: User Authentication and Authorization:** The system shall implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **FR8: Administration:** The system shall provide administrative tools for managing users, configuring system settings, viewing logs, and generating reports.
* **FR9: CrewAI Integration:** The system shall seamlessly integrate with CrewAI for AI processing, task management, and deployment.
* **FR10:  Error Handling and Logging:** The system shall implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.  Errors shall be logged with sufficient detail to facilitate debugging.
* **FR11: Scalability:** The system architecture must be scalable to handle a large volume of emails.
* **FR12:  Data Security:** The system shall adhere to all relevant data security and privacy regulations.


**3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The system shall process emails with minimal latency.  Response time should be less than 5 seconds for 99% of emails.
* **Security:**  The system shall protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.  Secure storage and transmission of sensitive information is required.
* **Usability:** The system shall be intuitive and easy to use for both administrators and end-users.
* **Reliability:** The system shall be highly reliable and available.  Uptime should be greater than 99.9%.
* **Maintainability:** The system shall be designed for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Portability:** The system should be deployable on various CrewAI Enterprise environments.


**4. Data Model (Django ORM)**

*(This section will require a more detailed elaboration in the design phase, but an example is given below)*

* **Email:**  id (PK), sender, recipient, subject, body, timestamp, classification, response_sent, attachments (JSON field).
* **EmailTemplate:** id (PK), category, template_text.
* **User:** id (PK), username, password, role (admin/user).
* **Log:** id (PK), timestamp, message, severity.


**5. API Specifications**

*(API specifications for Flask endpoints will be defined in the design phase.  Examples include endpoints for email processing, template management, and user authentication.)*

**6. Integration Details**

* **CrewAI:** Used for AI processing, task management, and deployment.  Specific CrewAI APIs will be identified and integrated during the development phase.
* **Chainlit:** Provides the user interface for interaction and configuration.
* **Flask:**  Handles API requests and integrates with other components.
* **Django:**  Provides the ORM for database management.
* **IMAP/SMTP:**  Handles email communication.
* **Google Gemini API:** Used for advanced AI capabilities such as response generation and sentiment analysis.


**7. Future Considerations**

* Integration with other productivity tools (calendar, CRM).
* Advanced features such as automatic meeting scheduling.
* Support for multiple languages.
