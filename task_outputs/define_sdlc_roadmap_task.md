**SDLC Roadmap: Automated AI Email Responder**

This roadmap outlines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for an Automated AI Email Responder, transitioning from a Python prototype to a production-ready CrewAI Enterprise application.

**Phase 1: Ideation (1 week)**

* **Goal:** Define project scope, features, and target audience.  Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for success.
* **Tasks:**
    * **Project Manager:** Define project scope, objectives, and success criteria.  Document user stories and acceptance criteria. (1 day)
    * **AI/ML Engineer:** Research suitable AI models for email classification and response generation. Explore Google Gemini API capabilities. (2 days)
    * **Backend Engineer:** Research suitable architecture for scalable email processing. Evaluate CrewAI Enterprise capabilities and limitations. (2 days)
    * **Frontend Engineer:** Design user interface (UI) for configuration and monitoring.  Investigate Chainlit integration for user interaction. (2 days)
* **Deliverables:** Project proposal, user stories, technical feasibility report, initial UI mockups.
* **Tools:**  Project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana), wireframing tools (e.g., Figma, Balsamiq).

**Phase 2: Analysis (2 weeks)**

* **Goal:**  Detailed requirements gathering, system architecture design, and technology selection.
* **Tasks:**
    * **Project Manager:** Create detailed task breakdown and project schedule. Assign tasks to team members. (2 days)
    * **AI/ML Engineer:** Fine-tune chosen AI model using sample email datasets. Develop API integration strategy for Google Gemini. (5 days)
    * **Backend Engineer:** Design database schema (Django ORM). Define API endpoints for email processing and response generation. (5 days)
    * **Frontend Engineer:** Develop detailed UI designs and wireframes for Chainlit integration. (5 days)
* **Deliverables:** Detailed requirements specification, system architecture diagram, database design document, API specifications.
* **Tools:**  UML modeling tools, database design tools, API documentation tools (e.g., Swagger).

**Phase 3: Design (1 week)**

* **Goal:**  Translate requirements into detailed design specifications for the UI, backend, and database.
* **Tasks:**
    * **Project Manager:** Review and approve design specifications. Schedule code reviews and testing. (1 day)
    * **AI/ML Engineer:** Design the workflow for email processing, classification, and response generation. (2 days)
    * **Backend Engineer:** Design the Flask backend, integrating CrewAI Enterprise, IMAP/SMTP libraries, and Django ORM. (2 days)
    * **Frontend Engineer:** Design the Chainlit interface for user interaction and configuration. (2 days)
* **Deliverables:** Detailed design document, UI specifications, database schema, API documentation.
* **Tools:**  Design software (e.g., Figma), database modeling tools.


**Phase 4: Development (4 weeks)**

* **Goal:**  Develop and implement the application according to design specifications.  Begin with prototyping using Python, CrewAI, and Chainlit.
* **Tasks:**  This phase involves iterative development with frequent code reviews and integration testing. Tasks are broken down daily and assigned using the Automated AI Email Responder for task assignment and progress tracking.
    * **Daily Tasks:**  Assigned via AI Email Responder based on the project management tool.  This includes coding, testing, and debugging.
* **Deliverables:**  Working prototype (Python, CrewAI, Chainlit),  gradually transitioning to Flask, Django, CrewAI Enterprise, IMAP/SMTP, and Google Gemini API.
* **Tools:**  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), version control system (Git), code review tools.

**Phase 5: Testing (2 weeks)**

* **Goal:**  Thoroughly test the application to ensure quality, functionality, and performance.
* **Tasks:**
    * **QA Engineer:** Develop and execute test cases covering functional, performance, security, and usability aspects. (2 weeks)
* **Deliverables:** Test plan, test cases, test results, bug reports, updated documentation.
* **Tools:** Testing frameworks (e.g., pytest, Selenium), bug tracking system (e.g., Jira).

**Phase 6: Deployment (1 week)**

* **Goal:** Deploy the application to the CrewAI Enterprise environment.
* **Tasks:**
    * **DevOps Engineer:** Configure the CrewAI Enterprise server. Deploy the application using appropriate tools and techniques.  Monitor and ensure stability. (1 week)
* **Deliverables:** Deployed application, monitoring dashboards, post-deployment report.
* **Tools:** Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), deployment tools, monitoring tools.

**Phase 7: Maintenance (Ongoing)**

* **Goal:** Provide ongoing support, maintenance, and updates to the application.
* **Tasks:**  Addressing bug reports, implementing enhancements, scaling the application, and monitoring performance.
* **Tools:**  Monitoring tools, logging systems, bug tracking system.


**Integration Points:**

* **CrewAI:**  Used for both prototyping and production deployment, providing core AI functionalities and enterprise-level capabilities.
* **Chainlit:** Provides the user interface for interaction and configuration.
* **Flask:**  The backend framework handling API requests and integrating with other components.
* **Django:** The ORM used for database management.
* **IMAP/SMTP:**  Handle email communication.
* **Google Gemini API:** Used for advanced AI capabilities.


This roadmap provides a high-level overview.  Each phase will require more detailed planning and task assignment using the Automated AI Email Responder to manage tasks dynamically based on progress and priorities.  Regular progress meetings will ensure the project stays on track and adapts to changing requirements.
