# Automated AI Email Responder System - Comprehensive Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Automated AI Email Responder system, including architectural design, integration steps, code implementation details, testing outcomes, and deployment guidelines.

## I. Architectural Design

The system comprises several interconnected components:

1. **Email Ingestion (Flask):** A Flask application responsible for connecting to the IMAP server, retrieving new emails, parsing email metadata, and publishing email data to a message queue.

2. **Message Queue (RabbitMQ):** A RabbitMQ instance used for asynchronous communication between the email ingestion service and the email processing service. This ensures scalability and fault tolerance.

3. **Email Processing (CrewAI & Gemini API):** This service consumes messages from the queue, utilizes the CrewAI API for initial email processing, and leverages the Google Gemini API for advanced natural language understanding and sentiment analysis.

4. **Response Generation & Email Sending (Django):** A Django application that generates responses based on the analysis from CrewAI and Gemini, and sends these responses via SMTP.  It also interacts with a database for storing email history and system configuration.

5. **Chainlit UI & Admin Panel (Django):** A Chainlit-based user interface for interaction and a Django admin panel for system management and monitoring.


## II. Integration Steps

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
    * Install Python 3.9 (or specified version).
    * Create a virtual environment and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.  (See Section IV for details on dependencies.)
    * Configure RabbitMQ (details in Section IV).
    * Configure Google Cloud Project (details in Section IV).
    * Configure Database (details in Section IV).


2. **Configure Email Server:**  Configure the Flask application to connect to the designated email server (IMAP/SMTP).  (See Section IV for details and security considerations.)


3. **Configure APIs:**  Obtain API keys for CrewAI and Google Gemini, and configure the email processing service accordingly. (Ensure security best practices are followed; avoid hardcoding keys directly in the code).


4. **Database Setup:** Initialize and configure the database used by the Django application.  (See Section IV for details).


5. **Deploy Components:** Deploy the Flask application, the Django application, and the RabbitMQ server. (Specific deployment instructions are in Section V).


## III. Code Implementation Details

* **Flask Application (`flask_app.py`):**  [Insert detailed explanation of the Flask application's code structure, including key functions, classes, and modules.  Include code snippets as necessary].
* **Django Application (`django_app.py`):** [Insert detailed explanation of the Django application's code structure, including key functions, classes, and modules.  Include code snippets as necessary].
* **RabbitMQ Configuration (`rabbitmq.conf`):** [If applicable, include details on RabbitMQ configuration file].
* **API Interaction Code (`api_interaction.py`):** [Include code snippets illustrating interaction with CrewAI and Gemini APIs.]

## IV. Test Environment and Dependencies

* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04
* **Python Version:** 3.9.7
* **Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):**
    ```
    Flask==2.3.2
    Django==4.2.5
    CrewAI==1.0.0  (or appropriate version)
    pika==1.3.1
    google-cloud-aiplatform==1.31.0
    # ... other dependencies
    ```
* **Email Server:** Gmail (Credentials obfuscated for security)
* **RabbitMQ:** Version 3.11.15, running on localhost:5672
* **Google Cloud Project:**  [Project ID obfuscated]
* **Database:** PostgreSQL 14 (Connection details obfuscated)


## V. Deployment Guidelines

1. **Setup Infrastructure:** Provision servers and configure necessary network settings.
2. **Deploy RabbitMQ:** Deploy and configure RabbitMQ instance as specified in Section IV.
3. **Deploy Flask Application:** Deploy the Flask application to a server.  [Provide specific instructions or commands].
4. **Deploy Django Application:** Deploy the Django application to a server.  [Provide specific instructions or commands].
5. **Database Migration:** Run database migrations to ensure the database schema is up-to-date.
6. **API Key Configuration:**  Configure API keys securely within environment variables.
7. **Testing:** Run the tests outlined in the test plan (Section VI) to verify proper functioning.
